Instructions for running my code :

I am using the following software at these versions:
* Python 3.8.2
* matplotlib: 3.3.2
* mlrose_hiive: 2.1.3
* numpy: 1.19.2
* sklearn: 0.23.2

Dataset for part 2 - phoneme - https://www.openml.org/d/1489

(Note: you are not required to manually download the dataset in order to run my code. My code automatically downloads it.)

Steps:

1- Clone this repository:
https://github.gatech.edu/dstrube3/CS7641_A2

2- Run these Jupyter Notebooks: 

	a- "A2 - Randomized Optimization - Part 1 - dstrube3.ipynb" 

	b- "A2 - Randomized Optimization - Part 2 - dstrube3.ipynb" 

3- Run each section of the Notebook in sequence to follow along with the analysis here:
dstrube3-analysis.pdf

4- Alternatively, you can find the most significant charts in the charts folder
