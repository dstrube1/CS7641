What metrices are people finding helpful in evaluating clusters (without labels)? I have used sum of squared errors (inertia in sklearn) and silhouette but haven't been getting much insight from either.

If you are using metrics where you don't know the ground truth, there's really only three metrics that scikit offers:

Inertia: Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center.
Generally want to use the Elbow Method: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)

Silhouette: A measure comparing distance between a sample and other members of the same class, and a sample and all other points in the next nearest cluster
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-kmeans-silhouette-analysis-py
You will generally want to maximize this

Davies-Bouldin Index: Measures the average "similarity" between clusters, which compares distance between clusters with the size of the clusters themselves
Similar to Silhouette ultimately but you will generally want to minimize this

Ultimately just make a choice and use it as the best option and justify it. If your data has 5 classes and your inertia/silo say you should have three, use it and discuss why this might be. It might also help to plot out the clusters formed by 2-3 variables. Do a PCA to figure out the 2-3 most important features and use those for the plots is generally best.

What do you mean by ground truth? labels? If you do have the ground truth what plots would you recommend?

Take a look at 2.3.10 Clustering Performance Evaluation - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means you'd want something like Adjusted Rand Index or V-Measure. But for this assignment you shouldn't use those values for actually deciding on clusters for anything, assume you don't know the labels.
