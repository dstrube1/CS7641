ch 4, p 99- how do you pronounce that?

possible sources of error:
faulty sensor 
malicious data
transcription (human)
unmodelled / extrinsic influence
faulty storage / RAM

data is assumed to be IID
independent and identically distributed
^ fundamental assumption in many algorithms

cross validation: using some training data (x) as test data (y) 
split sections of x into folds

vector input: multiple features => hyper plane
scalar: 0,1,2,3,..
discrete: yes/no, true/false, 0/1, on/off

best constant in terms of squared error: mean

initial weights should be small random values
